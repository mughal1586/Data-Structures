# 📚 Data-Structures (C++)

**Just some data structure related codes in C++.**  
A simple repo demonstrating core data structures implemented in C++, ideal for learning basic concepts and practicing implementations.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains basic C++ implementations of common data structures:

```

.
├── Dynamic Array/
├── Linked List/
├── Queue/ Simple/
├── Stack/

````

Each folder includes source code files illustrating how that particular data structure works in C++.

---

## 📌 What’s Included

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Array** | Demonstrates dynamic array operations (e.g., resizing, insertion). |
| **Linked List** | Singly linked list implementation with basic operations. |
| **Queue/ Simple** | Simple queue implementation (likely array or linked list based). |
| **Stack** | Stack implementation using array or pointers. |

> These implementations show how to build and use data structures from scratch in idiomatic C++. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔹 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mughal1586/Data-Structures.git
````

### 🔹 Compile & Run

1. Navigate into the folder you want to explore:

   ```bash
   cd Data-Structures/Linked\ List
   ```

2. Compile the code (example with `g++`):

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o linkedlist
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./linkedlist
   ```

> Use your preferred C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC) and adjust filenames accordingly.

## 🛠 Tools & Requirements

To work with and extend these examples, you’ll need:

* A **C++ compiler** supporting at least C++11.
* A code editor or IDE like **VS Code**, **CLion**, or **Visual Studio**.
* Basic familiarity with compiling and running console apps.

---

## 📖 Why This Repo?

This repository is great for:

* **Beginners** wanting hands-on practice with data structures.
* Understanding how basic data structures are built under the hood.
* Studying for exams or interviews where manual implementation is required.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can help by:

* Adding more data structures.
* Improving existing implementations with comments and tests.
* Adding README sections for each subfolder.

To contribute:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-structure`)
3. Commit your changes
